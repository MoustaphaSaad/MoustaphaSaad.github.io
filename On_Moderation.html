<p>Bring forth what’s true; Write it down so that it’s clear. Defend it to your last breath.</p>
<h2 id="back-story">Back-story</h2>
<p>When I was a kid i remember watching some documentary where they discussed the life/work of Ludwig Boltzmann there was one thing that stuck in my memory till now that thing is the first three sentences you read in this post. For the rest of my life I took those words to heart; hence my opinions tend to be on the extremes. I always search for what’s objectively true even for things others would call a preference I always try to find a reason for it and I always change them to match what’s true.</p>
<h2 id="imagine-the-average">Imagine the average</h2>
<p>Imagine the average human, and try to answer these questions. Would he be interesting?. Would he be creative?, Would he be leader?, Would he be knowledgeable?, … etc. The answer to all these questions is NO. By definition he wouldn’t excel in anything. He wouldn’t be different, this difference is necessary for all the traits above.</p>
<p>I despise the average thing. An average human is a human who is stupid enough to not have any opinion about anything his only opinion is that everything should be average, he didn’t even bother to formulate a new opinion or adopt an already existing one, he would always reach for the average/popular opinion. In fact I hate the average thing more than the bad thing, at least the bad thing is trying to understand and through this understanding -although being wrong- he signals that he is trying and there’s an opportunity for a conversation with him about his viewpoint and even persuading him with another opinion. Average humans in my head are slimy gray blob of matter and they always try to abolish the world off its colors.</p>
<p>“ربنا يولي من يصلح”</p>
<h2 id="you-are-just-egotistic">You are just egotistic</h2>
<p>Remember “Bring forth what’s <strong>true</strong>”. first of all don’t just have a strong opinions on anything you didn’t study, and always remember to revisit and search for counter-points to your opinion.</p>
<p>Every time I find someone with a different opinion I get excited for the possibility of an interesting discussion about the topic. Maybe I will end up viewing the problem under a completely new light. Maybe we’ll finally find the true solution we all searching for.</p>
<p>In a discussion about programming one of the most disappointing sentences I can hear is “but it’s (popular/many people use it/just better/what we learned/easier)”. DUDE!! I’m talking in facts/logic/evidence the only way this discussion should go is by facts/logic/evidence.</p>
<h2 id="extremes">Extremes</h2>
<p>Extremes are fun. There are plenty of chances to explore the unknown, learn new things, appreciate old things that you always took for granted. I invite you to take an extreme decision and follow it to the end and see where you’d end up with. for example: write an application in plain C, use JS to do a high performance software, put each single “object/class” in a library, write an OS in JS!, add GC to C!!, use communicating processes instead of threads in C, write functional programming in C++, try haskell, etc…, usually average people don’t try out things like this. I guarantee that you’ll learn more this way than other traditional techniques. maybe some day you’ll be better than your run-off-the-mill CS student when you accumulate enough experience from such experiments. Did i mention the FUN!</p>
<h2 id="moderation">Moderation</h2>
<p>There are plenty of space for disagreement, after all life is not binary but disagreement requires another strong opinion to disagree with in the first place!. Sticking to the gooey state of averages will lead you nowhere. For example I might disagree with Golang on some points like the GC but they have a strong reasoning for putting a GC that I disagree with but I appreciate the difference because this is not just an empty point of difference/disagreement I acknowledge that GC existence is a big part of Golang personality.</p>
<p>So, yeah big surprise you can disagree with someone and also appreciate the difference. for example in my opinion Golang overall is a much more solid language than C++ -although i don’t use it-</p>
<p>Moderation in expressing negative traits -like anger- is appreciated and certainly a good thing. Moderation in non-negative things will lead you nowhere.</p>
