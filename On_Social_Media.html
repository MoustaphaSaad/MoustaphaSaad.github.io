<p>07, Jan, 2019</p>
<p>Humans have sacrificed a lot to evolve the ability to use language to facilitate the communication between individuals. They all start with a primitive languages which can only represent concrete things to big complicated beasts like the modern human languages which are capable of representing abstract ideas. The purpose of most languages is to share the information between people by sharing the experiences so let me share my experience on social media with.</p>
<h2 id="quantifying-social-interactions">Quantifying social interactions</h2>
<p>When humans communicate they keep track of an underlying score, you are in a sense always assessing what being said, and what others may think about what you say, Is talking to this human a nice/pleasant experience? and that score is an implicit unquantifiable value that humans experience which they optimize for, for example many people ask “How to be a good speaker?”, “How to build a good writing skill?”, …etc in their search for ways to optimize for this trait. The main issue with that is now all social media platforms have a way to give you a number which represents how popular are you and how “viral” is what you say. Now human interactions are officially a game and social media networks will keep the score. This makes people obsess over these numbers and in their struggle to get more likes/retweets/share they tend to commit some of the most horrible crimes one can make in a social interaction</p>
<h2 id="interaction-speed">Interaction speed</h2>
<p>In this day and age everything is fast, too fast actually. Life shouldn’t be that fast. The interaction speed is one of the most vital properties of an interaction. Humans tend to feel first then think, which is logical in a sense since thinking requires time, your first instinct will always be based on emotions(the primitive self) then when you think about the subject at hand you will engage your intellectual abilities. Social media is too fast to engage any intellectual conversation at all. People will say what make them look smart rather then putting the effort and investing the time to be smart; Remember that looking smart will give a higher score in the social media game. Why invest the time to learn new things when you can just repeat the words that will make you look smart without any deeper understanding of them.</p>
<p>On that note also speaker speed influence how they have a conversation if you always talk quickly without any pauses to think about what you say or what’s being said to you, you won’t learn anything because in order to learn you have to listen to what the others have to say on that subject and dissect their argument. It’s like you are blinded by your words; Remember that in order to have a constructive conversation you need to let the world change you the same way you yourself change the world and that will happen by slowing things down, take your time to think about what’s being said and speak when you have something to say. Nobody will judge you if you took a minute or two to think about something. At some point in your life you’ll stop worrying about the silly opinions others have about you.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>In order to learn new things you have to go where no-one else went before. In order to learn you have to risk to offend someone in your inquiry to understand his viewpoints/opinion. For a moment imagine the most average person you can think of and try to answer these questions. Will this average human be interesting?, Will you enjoy working/speaking to this average human?, Will this average human be an innovative/creative person?. The answer is simple no, no, and no. It’s a high-risk/high-reward situation here, you risk looking weird by going where no-one have gone before but in reward you’ll discover a new thing or two, you risk offending others but the reward is that you will truly understand their opinion/viewpoint.</p>
<p>The social media game does not favor this style of thinking, you only have a finite set of templates of things you are allowed to think/talk about, and these rules is enforced by the community of these websites through the use of the score tools. When you write a thing and it doesn’t get many likes/shares/retweets you will know that people didn’t like it and thus the overall system incentives you to only talk about those templates and don’t stray away from these subject in order to be acceptable in the community; Remember in this day and age a like/share/retweet is a concrete, official, objective, and measurable score of acceptance.</p>
<h2 id="emotions">Emotions</h2>
<p>Most social media websites works on an emotional level rather than an intellectual one, that’s why the most common responses to posts are likes/emojis and other emotions based responses no one will take the time to write a complete article dismantling what you said, heck most people nowadays can’t even reach this sentence in a post like that; Remember that all these sites have their foundations in the speed of the interaction -Twitter is 140 character, Vine is 6 seconds, Instagram is 15 seconds, …etc-. Actually the interaction is so short that is fails to be an interaction, it’s rather a <strong>reaction</strong> you spend most of the time scrolling through these websites and reacting emotionally to what you see and this long exposure will eventually re-program what/how you think.</p>
<p>Sadly now we don’t have a meaningful conversation where we inspect/compare/explore our ideas as a community anymore; What we have now is a reaction-based mob mentality where we seek to destroy everything that doesn’t follow the templates. One of the most powerful emotions that most popular people exploit is anger, they will post something that will invoke an anger emotion in most people to get their attention, or they will channel the anger towards a something. I’m not saying that I’m always that logical, I enjoy shit-talking myself sometimes, but i know how/when to have fun and when to have a serious conversation</p>
<h2 id="shallow-content">Shallow content</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful aspects of social media is that it makes you feel that you need it.</p>
<p>How would i know the news?, Well, my friend most of the news on social media sites won’t affect you at all and most of the news that will affect your life you don’t need social media to know about in the first place so social media creates the illusion that you are “getting the news” where in fact you are scrolling through some info which will have minor to zero effect on your life.</p>
<p>But hey look at all this scientific content surely you’re not against since?, The typical science stuff you’ll find on social media is the likes of “let’s melt lipsticks”, “1000 degree knife”, “Be a gamedev/make a mobile app in 5 simple steps” and other dumb stuff in many fields which will create the illusion that your are learning but as i said above learning by definition/nature requires time, reading, and trail and error, sure all these stuff are fun and you might learn something in the process but you won’t get the full experience.</p>
<p>But how i would reach people?, you can reach people in real life by meeting them, you can call them, send an e-mail, you don’t need a social media website to reach people, and people that really need you will find a way to reach you.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m not suggesting to delete your social media account -I did exactly that- but I’m writing because if you know how to manage your interaction online according to the things i discussed above your quality of life will be tremendously better, you don’t have to have an opinion/input about everything that happens, and frankly most people don’t really need a computer in their everyday life, you can limit your access to the social media sites to your PC or to an hour a day or something along these lines, you can for once control when/how to use the internet instead of the internet controlling you.</p>
