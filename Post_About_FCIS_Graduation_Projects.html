<p>
Hello, Moustapha here and let's talk about the state of the Graduation
Projects(GP) in FCIS
</p>

<p>
You are a 4th year student and most probably you will choose a
Machine-Learning(ML) related GP but my advice to you is to take a deep breath and think why you want to
do such project.
</p>

<p>
Most probably you are just following the trend, also many of the FCIS don't know
any better, but let me tell you son my GP involved was a ML centric (at least my
part involved Convolutional NN and recurrent NN) and in short it was just
finding about 1 million coefficient of a series of functions so basically it
was about brute-forcing our way through function optimization which to put it
mildly is not interesting for the simple reason that you won't learn anything
of value in the process since you won't implement anything yourself anyway you
will just use any library like (Tensorflow, Torch, Matlab, ... etc).
</p>

<p>
Don't take it from me here's the guy that made the back-propagation algorithm
himself talking about the current state of ML:

  pioneer says we need to start over</a>
</p>

<p>
  So let me suggest some ideas for GPs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  For years we were limping on lex/yacc for compiler frontends. they are great
  tools but they are too old to be that useful so why not have a shot at
  creating a modern lexer/parser generators/analyzers which can generate C++
  lexers and parsers also they can analyze the grammar, recognize it's category,
  find ambiguities, visualize Syntax trees, live editing where i submit some
  example program and while i edit the grammar rules it tries to parse the
  example program in real-time and visualize the parsed tree. also you maybe
  have shot at General parsers algorithms, Non-Deterministic parsers, ... etc.
  </li>

  <li>
  C is great language why not make FCIS C optimizer compiler, i mean this alone
  would open the doors for future projects to experiment with different
  optimization techniques which would be applied directly to the above C
  optimizer and would be great for research purposes.
  </li>

  <li>
  While C is a great language it's lacking in a lot of areas: security, productivity,
  meta-programming, ... etc. why not do a new language which fixes one or more
  of the points above.
  </li>

  <li>
  CAD design is of paramount importance in a lot of industries, so if you are in
  SC department why not try making a CAD application, you have even focus on a
  simple things like:
  <ul>
  <li>
	Boolean Operations: Union, subtraction, intersection of 3d meshes
  </li>
  <li>
  	Mesh Repair: Many 3d meshes have some problems like intersected triangles, degenerate
  	triangles, flipped triangles ... you can have a shot at fixing those kind of
  	errors
  </li>
  <li>
  	Sculpting: Many of the digital art now is using sculpting techniques (Zbrush
  	for example) so why not have a shot at mesh deformation, smoothing,
	subdivision ... etc.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
  UI programming is a hard problem but one that could be somewhat
  solved. There're many JS/Electron apps nowadays but as you may notice their
  performance and memory consumption is not that great either and you can't
  relay on them in a real high performance situations due to the fact that they
  just are a version of chrome which runs some website locally on your computer
  and that's not very efficient to put it mildly, so why not create a UI library
  for C++ which is inspired by how these apps work where you "render" UI
  elements by providing some textual representation (HTML-like or any other
  variant) and hook it to some C++ logic code in the background ... etc (you
  have to study how these apps work and what's good and bad about these
  techniques and bring what's good to native programming language like C++, this
  is an introduction to the problem after all). I think this
  would simplify UI programming in native languages alot.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These are just the tip of the iceberg there's symbolic analysis, computer
graphics maybe do a rasterization engine for software rendering and use it in
the ui programming stuff, Use the compiler backend from the C optimizer compiler
to make better compatible libraries that's platform independent which integrates
seamlessly with current C programs, Fiddle with how the pointers is defined and
see how would this affect the safety aspect of the language, use the better C
language as an embeddable language in itself instead of the C, Lua combo, use all
of above projects to create a web browser, create a different/better ui
describing medium than HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p>
The point is that there's more to Computer science research than ML stuff
because to be quite honest ML stuff is not that interesting or stimulating.

These are only ideas from a single man ask other people and yet there's more out
there . If you are interested in a specific field then you may ask your teachers
they may have some good ideas.
